    ```
    Area = 0.433012 * edge * edge
    ```
4. Write a program that prompts the user to enter
the exchange rate from currency in U.S. dollars to Indian Rupee. Prompt the user to enter 0 to convert from U.S. dollars to Indian Rupee and 1 to convert from Indian Rupee and U.S. dollars. Prompt the user to enter the amount in U.S. dollars or Indian Rupee to convert it to Indian Rupee or U.S. dollars, respectively. Here are the sample runs:
    ```
    Enter the exchange rate from dollars to Indian Rupee: 83.61
    Enter 0 to convert dollars to Indian Rupee and 1 vice versa: 0
    Enter the dollar amount: 100
    $100 is  8361 INR
    ```
    ```
    Enter the exchange rate from dollars to Indian Rupee: 83.61
    Enter 0 to convert dollars to Indian Rupee and 1 vice versa: 1
    Enter the INR amount: 1000
    1000 INR is 11.96 USD
